# Author Setup Guide
In order to fully support the various features of this launcher, some additional steps will be needed from you.<br>
Some features will require your permission to use, additional files provided or mod download/community links.<br>
As mentioned, no coding is needed for any of these customizations and the instructions are outlined below.<br>

## Step 1: Edit modinfo.json
All of the D2RLaunch customizations are determined by this file, since it is included/required by your mod already.<br>
With that said, please edit your modinfo.json file using the following template, being sure to respect the line counts.<br>
The launcher will compare the players file to the web file to determine mod version status and control features/info.<br>
Change your enabled/disabled options as desired (Expect the Option Controls to be updated in future releases)<br>
```

    "savepath": "MyModName/"

```

## Step 2: Setup Mod File Linking
In order to provide downloading, updating and configuration changes to be made dynamically by the launcher, we need to setup proper links.
For a proper link, it needs to be both **static** and **direct**.<br>
- **Static** - This means when the file has been updated/replaced, the link itself does not change
- **Direct** - This means that when the link is clicked, the file is downloaded directly, not a webpage button download

To setup a link that satisfies both of these requirements, you can use services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Github, Amazon S3, etc.
Provided below are instructions for some of them I have used previously or currently:
- **Github** - Click the green Code button, then right-click the Download Zip option and select Copy Link Address
- **Google Drive** - Copy your google provided link into this [Online Generator](https://sites.google.com/site/gdocs2direct/) to convert it to a static-direct link.<br>
When updating the file, you must use the **File Properties > File Information > Manage Versions** method<br>
- **Dropbox** - Replace the **&dl=0** at the end of your dropbox provided url with **&dl=1**

The First time you upload modinfo.json, you will need to use a dummy config link, because you havnt uploaded it yet<br>
I recommend adding your mod to the [Mod Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RMqexbqTzxOyjk7tWbLhRYJk9RkzPGJ9cKHSLtsuGII/edit#gid=0), which allows players to easily view and install your mod.<br>
*As long as you follow the above linking rules, then the links provided in your modinfo.json file will never need to be updated between mod or config changes!*<br>

## Step 3: Enabling Optional Features
For some features, additional files must be provided to D2RLaunch, due to the variety of changes/complexity.<br>
As an example, the Event Manager cannot host Special Events if it has no instructions or files provided for this task.<br>
Any feature that is optional or requires file-safekeeping will use a new D2RLaunch folder in your mod directory.<br>
Each feature will be placed in it's own subfolder within it, following these rules:<br>

**Runeword Menu Sorting:** Utilizes a folder named **Runeword Sort** and may contain up to 6 files:
- **runewords-ab.json / helppanelhd-ab.json:** Used to display the runewords sorted **Alphabetically**
- **runewords-it.json / helppanelhd-it.json:** Used to display the runewords sorted **By ItemType**
- **runewords-lv.json / helppanelhd-lv.json:** Used to display the runewords sorted **By Required Level**<br>

*helppanel* files are optional if you've chosen to replace it with your runeword menu (quick-access)

**UI Theme:** Utilizes a folder named **UI Theme** and should contain 2 folders (for now):
- **Retail:** Used to display your own modified UI, based on the Retail Theme.
- **ReMoDDeD:** Used to display the heavily customized UI, based on the ReMoDDeD mod.

**Merged HUD:** Utilizes a folder named **Merged HUD** and should contain 2 folders (for now):
- **Retail:** Used to display your own modified HUD UI, based on the Retail Theme.
- **Merged:** Used to display the heavily customized HUD UI, based on the ReMoDDeD mod.

**Buff Icons:** Utilizes a folder named **Buff Icons** and should contain X files (explained below, not yet complete):
- **Skill_Names.txt:** Used to provide the launcher with your mods list of *buff skills* (if different from retail).
- **Preview_SkillName.png:** For each custom buff icon you have, include an image the launcher can use for it.

**Custom Mod/App Logo:** Looks for a file named **Logo.png** to be used in the top left of D2RLaunch.<br>
The size of the logo can vary to your liking, but I recommend something around 200x200 or so.

As previously mentioned, some folders will be created automatically by the launcher, mostly for file-safekeeping:
- **Customizations:** Created to store unedited copies of the armor, misc, weapons, levels and treasureclass txt files.<br>
This is needed for the Monster Customizations options to work correctly.<br>
- **Monster Stats:** Created to store edited copies of the monster hp bar layout files, for various option displays.<br>
This is needed for the Monster Stats option to work correctly.

## Step 4: Updating Mod, News, Features or Appearance
To update your mod or config files, simply replace the .zip or .json file used in w/e you service chose in **Step 2**.<br>
If you followed those instructions carefully, then the link does not need updating and your edits are immediately live.<br>
When D2RLaunch goes to download the mod or access the config file; it will retrieve the updated version(s).<br>
You can use this to dynamically update mod files, allowed features, news messages, app logo, etc.<br>
Keep in mind that you are *pushing* data to the web, and the launcher is automatically *pulling* that data down.<br>

# Program Requirements/Specifications

It is needed to perform CASC Extraction of internal game storage.
- **Windows OS:** This is the only supported Operating System for the launcher, although emulation layers may also work for it (WINE, Lutris, etc)<br>
- **Battle.Net Purchased:** This program is only intended for and actively tries to be restricted to, legally purchased D2R copies. If you want to support modding, then purchase the game!<br>
- **Code Base:** This program was designed using C# and WPF. I am a novice coder, so expect inconsistencies, inefficiencies and general issues.<br>
- **D2RHUD.dll:** This file is used to enable hotkey controls and advanced monster stats display options [(Source)](https://github.com/locbones/D2RHud)<br>

# Developer Notes
This app was made because I am passionate about helping everyone get the most out of their D2R experience.<br>
I put much effort into making it easy, open and powerful, while balancing it with author intentions/efforts.<br>
So thanks for everyones patience and support during this free-time side project of mine; some final words on it:

**To The Players:**<br>
Enjoy the many new QoL features, mod controls and hassle-free modding that comes with using D2RLaunch.<br>
I know sometimes the worst part about modding, can be dealing with all the frustration and confusion around them.<br>
I also know that everyone likes to play just a little bit differently, and noone can say no to some added QoL.<br>
So I hope this app helps fill in a large gap of what may have been missing from your mod experience.

**To The Authors**<br>
Enjoy what I hope is a very simple, code-less method to control the launchers various systems to your liking.<br>
I know sometimes it can be frustrating dealing with so many files, troubleshooting with your community, etc.<br>
I also know that many of the same features get requested by players or wish were included by default.<br>
So I hope this app helps provide some of that to your player-base; letting them enjoy your mod even longer.

**To The Developers**<Br>
I respectfully request that you help improve this project rather than fork it, if you wish to modify it.<br>
Much effort was made to allow authors control of the launcher in a dynamic fashion, without coding needed.<br>
I wish for it to be open and hope you might be convinced to help improve it further.<br>
With that said; a standard **GPL License** has been attached to this project.

In order for build deployment, you will need to provide your own Licenses/API Keys for the following services:<br>
**SyncFusion:** Used for various form controls and library functions<br>
**Google Sheets:** Used to retrieve the Mod Listing from the Mod Database and update the Download Dropdown<br>
File should be named *appSettings.json* and placed in the *Resources* folder. An example file has already been included.<br>
